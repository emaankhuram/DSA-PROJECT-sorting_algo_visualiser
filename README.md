#Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Overview

This project is a web-based visualizer for sorting algorithms, designed to provide an interactive way to understand and analyze the working of various sorting techniques. It combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and uses C++ for backend performance testing and advanced algorithm implementation.

Features

Interactive Visualization: Real-time graphical representation of sorting processes.

Multiple Algorithms: Includes various sorting techniques such as:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Merge Sort

Quick Sort

Counting Sort

Radix Sort

Custom Input: Users can input custom arrays or generate random arrays of different sizes.

Speed Control: Adjustable animation speed for better understanding.


Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: C++ for testing and advanced computations

Requirements

A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)

A C++ compiler (for backend testing and performance comparison)
